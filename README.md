# Tesla-car-model
This project is a responsive and interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase different models of Tesla cars (Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y). The website visually updates performance metrics and background images dynamically when the user clicks on each car model.
